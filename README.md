# Antfarm

Antfarm is the product of a 4 day sprint at Fullstack Academy. It is a collaborative platform for the real-time co-creation of atomic crypto-art. Built with three.js and socketio for bi-directional transmission of shared geometric data. Includes a voxel modeler (inspired and based on Mr doob's [voxel painter](https://mrdoob.com/projects/voxels/)) Also includes support for multiple rooms and real-time messaging services over sockets for social building and project management. Built with Three.js, React, Redux, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, and Socket.io.
